# Introduction

My second brain built currently using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).
# Hosting

Write, Save, Publish
## Write

Wiki is managed as `Markdown files` categorized in `Folders`. These text files are written via `Obsidian`.

## Save

Once files are modified, they're automatically written to a remote `Git repository` via Obsidian plugin called `git`. https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git

## Publish

Once its saved in a Git repository, there is a `Github Action` to publish the site as `Github Pages`.

Now, you can configure a custom domain to host the static content.
